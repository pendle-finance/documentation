POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USE OF PENDLE PROTOCOL" title="Direct link to 11.	POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USE OF PENDLE PROTOCOL">​</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Use of Pendle Protocol is at the User’s own risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User acknowledges and agrees to assume all risks including the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Underlying Protocol Risk</strong>: Pendle Protocol is built on and is composable on several Non-Pendle Underlying Protocols. There is no assurance that the Non-Pendle Underlying Protocols are functioning or will continue to function as expected. If there are any adverse events affecting the Non-Pendle Underlying Protocols, it could result in a material adverse impact on User’s position on the Pendle Protocol. Such adverse events include without limitation, a de-peg in the price of a stablecoin or synthetically-pegged token, an exploit or cybersecurity compromise, oracle failure, freezing of assets or default by the Non-Pendle Underlying Protocols. The Non-Pendle Underlying Protocols may also operate in a manner that undermines or adversely affects PT, YT and Pendle Protocol as a whole, including without limitation, not honouring yield distributions to be made to the holders of PT and/or YT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product Sophistication (including stablecoins, wrappers, etc.)</strong>: Assets issued by Non-Pendle Underlying Protocols that integrated with Pendle Protocol can be sophisticated. You shall do your own due diligence and be satisfied with the risks you are assuming, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1.	Products which are termed or characterised as stablecoins which may have price-stable characteristics but are structured differently from traditionally understood dollar or treasury-backed stablecoins like USD coin issued by Circle (“USDC”). In general, whilst stablecoins (including USDC) may possess price-stable characteristics, User should not assume that all stablecoins function in the same manner. In respect of all stablecoins, there is no assurance that User may ultimately be able receive any yields promised, and/or to recover the expected dollar-denominated amount for various reasons, including but not limited to a de-peg in price due to the insolvency of the issuer, the lack of liquidity to redeem the relevant stablecoin, a malfunction or exploit in the system supporting price stability of a stablecoin, or a change in the terms and conditions under which the relevant stablecoin is issued. The Pendle Group makes no representation in respect of any of such assets termed as stablecoins, including but not limited to how such stablecoins are structured, and whether User may be able to recover any value associated with such stablecoin.</p>
<p>2.	Products which track, or are wrappers or synthetic representations of, more traditionally understood products (“<strong>RWA Associated Products</strong>”), which for the avoidance of doubt are neither issued by the Company nor its Affiliates. In general, whilst such RWA Associated Products may track the price of an underlying traditionally understood asset (or commonly referred to as “<strong>Real World Assets</strong>” or “<strong>RWA</strong>”) the underlying RWA Associated Product, there is no assurance that User may ultimately be able to receive any yields promised, to recover the underlying RWA Associated Product, and/or to recover any dollar-denominated value expected from holding, trading or participating in Real World Assets or RWA. This could be for many reasons, including but not limited to a de-peg in price due to, among other things, the insolvency, malfeasance of the issuer, the lack of liquidity to redeem the RWA Associated Products, or a change in the terms and conditions under which the relevant RWA Associated Products are issued. The Pendle Group makes no representation in respect of any of such assets termed or associated with the RWA Associated Products or RWA, how such RWA Associated Products or RWAs are structured, and whether User may be able to recover any value associated with such RWA Associated Products or RWA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monetary Loss</strong>: Trading cryptographic tokens are highly risky and can result in losses including total loss. Where tokens are deposited in pools or vaults which includes or is exposed to other tokens, the movement in price relative to such other tokens and vice versa can result in impermanent loss, which may eventually realise into actual losses on withdrawal or termination of the User’s position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liquidation Risks</strong>: Where leverage is used, there is a risk of being liquidated, which may involve a total loss of your assets or capital. Liquidation may occur for various reasons, including a situation where your position is no longer supported by the value of your collateral based on the risk parameters of the Pendle Protocol. Automated liquidation can also occur in periods of high price volatility (whether such price volatility is caused by market movements or inaccurate or incorrect price feeds and other market structure issues) which results in auto-deleveraging (“<strong>ADL</strong>”). ADL is built into the risk parameters of Pendle Protocol and can occur even if your position would otherwise have been profitable, to avoid or mitigate the risk of bad debt of the Pendle Protocol. In the event of ADL, losses may effectively be socialised amongst other users. You accept the risk of total loss if your position is liquidated whether it occurs due to ADL or otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technology / Smart Contract Risk</strong>: While security audits are carried on certain code infrastructure of Pendle Protocol, there is no assurance that such security audits are sufficient, comprehensive or that such security audits represent that Pendle Protocol is immune from exploits. Open technologies are typically targeted by bad actors and are vulnerable to exploits. There may be vulnerabilities or bugs in distributed networks, protocols, systems and smart contracts and there is no assurance that Pendle Protocol or any other protocol connected to the Pendle Protocol would be immune from attacks or exploits resulting in loss to User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risks related to distributed network consensus mechanisms</strong>: Distributed networks and blockchains are based on various consensus mechanisms (including but not limited to ‘proof-of-work’ or ‘proof-of-stake’ mechanisms) each having inherent risks. These include majority control risks, malicious or exploitive actions by nodes or network participants or a failure of such consensus mechanisms to work as intended resulting in forks and/or other circumstances resulting in disruption or loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risks associated, hardware, software or service providers</strong>: Hardware and software disruptions can happen including disruptions from infrastructure service providers (including but not limited to cloud service providers).  Pendle Protocol may be adversely affected by such disruptions which may result in disruption or loss to the User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Volatility Risk</strong>: Digital assets and tokens are highly speculative and are usually subject to high price volatility. There is no assurance that these digital assets (including but not limited to PENDLE token, PT, YT and Yield-Bearing Assets), tokens and/or financial positions will have or will continue to have any market value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tax Risks</strong>: Tax treatment on digital assets and financial positions in connection with Pendle Protocol may have adverse tax consequences and you should seek independent tax and financial advice in connection with your use of Pendle Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory Risk</strong>: The laws, regulations and guidelines governing digital assets, distributed technologies and cryptographic tokens are uncertain and may apply or change in such a way as to have an adverse effect on User and User’s use of Pendle Protocol, including materially adverse effect on the distributed ledger industry, Pendle Protocol, the Pendle Group, and any asset in connection with Pendle Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operational Risk</strong>: Contributors to Pendle Protocol may be compelled to cease operations for financial reasons, regulatory restrictions, hostile actions, legal proceedings, or any other circumstance that would make operations no longer viable. In such event, the development of Pendle Protocol may be disrupted and may not continue to operate as expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Force Majeure</strong>: Acts of God, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, riots, civil commotions, widespread communicable diseases and other force majeure events may occur resulting in adverse effects on Pendle Protocol and User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Token Risk</strong>: You shall not view or treat the PENDLE Token as a form of investment and shall only acquire the PENDLE Token with a view towards utilising PENDLE Token to participate in furthering the development of the Pendle Protocol. Similar to other cryptographic tokens in the industry, there can be no assurance of any value or of a constantly available market to acquire PENDLE Tokens with sufficient liquidity. You accept all risks (including all losses) associated with PENDLE Token as yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unanticipated Risks</strong>: Notwithstanding the risks set out herein (which may not be complete), there can be risks that are not anticipated. Such unanticipated risks may realise into adverse consequences or loss to the User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Risk</strong>: Trading digital assets and/or providing liquidity of the same entails a high financial risk. User has necessary experience and knowledge to understand the risks involved. User should carefully assess User’s financial circumstances and risk tolerance and where appropriate, seek third party financial advice before engaging in the aforementioned activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Address Handling Risks</strong>. User is solely responsible for verifying the accuracy and authenticity of blockchain addresses in connection with the use of Pendle Protocol. User may interact with malicious, spoofed, cloned, modified or unofficial smart contracts, websites, interfaces or applications including phishing or impersonated interfaces designed to trick User into sending assets incorrectly. Such transactions, if executed on the blockchain is effectively irreversible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in these Terms or the Website shall be construed as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>financial or investment advice. We do not provide any view on the merits of any particular investment. Any information provided is for educational purposes and to keep investors informed of prices, ranges, and volatility of digital assets and derivatives thereof. No person in the Pendle Group acts as your broker, intermediary, agent or advisor in any capacity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any marketing, promotion or offer for any product or investment to User or any third party.

User shall be responsible for User’s decisions relating to Pendle Protocol which are User’s own.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like all software, Pendle Protocol may be subject to exploits, accordingly, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible to User for any such exploits or loss to User as a result of such exploits, whether foreseeable or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the Company has taken a number of precautions to ensure the security of Pendle Protocol including obtaining third-party security audits, the technology constituting Pendle Protocol, and their interaction, is relatively new and it is not possible to guarantee that the code is completely free from bugs or errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User accepts all risks that arise from User’s access and/or use of Pendle Protocol, including and not limited to, the risk of any of Pendle Protocol Supported Assets being lost due to a failure or exploit of Pendle Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User is solely responsible for securing the private keys associated with any Supported Wallet which User uses when accessing and/or using Pendle Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User understands that anyone who obtains User’s private keys to User’s Supported Wallet and/or access to User’s device containing such private keys, may access User’s Supported Wallet controlled with those private keys with or without User’s authorisation and may transfer any Pendle Protocol Supported Assets accessible through User’s Supported Wallet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In choosing to access and/or use Pendle Protocol, User does so on User’s own initiative and at User’s own risk, and User is responsible for complying with all applicable local laws, rules and regulations relating to User’s access and/or use of Pendle Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for the Pendle Protocol may be modified or discontinued at any time in Pendle Group’s sole discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event of a change in the operating rules or other features of the relevant code (“<strong>Fork</strong>”) that may result in more than one version of a network (“<strong>Forked Network</strong>”) and more than one version of a digital asset (“<strong>Forked Asset</strong>”), Pendle Protocol may not support activity related to any Forked Assets. Forked Networks and the available supply of any Forked Assets are wholly outside Pendle Group’s control. In the event of a Fork, Pendle Group may temporarily suspend certain services on the Website (with or without advance notice to User) while it is determined which Forked Network(s) to support. Pendle Group shall not be responsible for a lack of support for any Forked Asset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using Pendle Protocol, User is using Pendle Protocol “as is” and “as available” with no representations or warranties whatsoever. To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates makes any express or implied representations and warranties, including implied representations or warranties of accuracy, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement in relation to Pendle Protocol. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates is responsible or liable for any error, delay or interruption in or lack of access to Pendle Protocol or for any loss of digital assets (including but not limited to Pendle Protocol Supported Assets) occasioned by or attributable to the Pendle Protocol.</p>
