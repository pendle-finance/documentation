## Bridging Back to Ethereum

To move your $PENDLE back to Ethereum from any of the supported chains:
1. Open the same bridge platform used to bridge out (linked above).
2. Select the source chain (e.g., Arbitrum, Mantle, etc.) and Ethereum as the destination.
3. Choose PENDLE, approve the transaction, and confirm the bridge.
4. Wait for confirmation (bridging times vary by chain).

Note: Always double-check the destination wallet address and ensure you have enough native gas tokens (ETH, BNB, etc.) to cover fees on the source chain.
