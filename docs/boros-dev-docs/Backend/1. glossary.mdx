## Core Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Market** | A trading market uniquely identified by `marketId`, with one collateral token and specific parameters |
| **Asset** | Any token in the system, identified by `tokenId` (e.g., USDT has 6 decimals, BTC has 8) |
| **Root** | EVM address (0x-prefixed) serving as the primary trading identity |
| **Account** | Sub-account under a root (IDs 0-255). Account `0` is default for trading; `255` is reserved for AMM |
| **Agent** | Wallet authorized to trade on your behalf but cannot withdraw funds |
| **Market Account** | Unique trading context: `(root, subaccountId, tokenId, marketId)`. Use `CROSS_MARKET_ID` (16777215) for cross-margin, or specific `marketId` for isolated |
| **Decimals** | Deposits/withdrawals use native token decimals; trading/balances always use 18 decimals internally |

| **Order** | Trade instruction with `orderId`, `tick` (price level), `side`, `size` (18 decimals), and `tif` |
| **Tick** | Integer price level. Formula: `rate = 1.00005^(tick × tickStep) - 1`. Use SDK helpers to convert |
| **Slippage** | Max acceptable price impact as percentage (market orders only) |
| **AMM** | Automated market maker providing continuous liquidity |

## SDK Helpers

```typescript
import { MarketAccLib, CROSS_MARKET_ID, estimateTickForRate, getRateAtTick } from "@pendle/sdk-boros";
import { FixedX18 } from "@pendle/boros-offchain-math";

// Pack market account
const marketAcc = MarketAccLib.pack(walletAddress, accountId, tokenId, CROSS_MARKET_ID);

// Convert between tick and rate
const tick = estimateTickForRate(FixedX18.fromNumber(0.05), tickStep, false);
const rate = getRateAtTick(tick, tickStep);

// Convert decimals
const size = FixedX18.fromNumber(100).value.toString();
const amount = FixedX18.fromBigIntString(balanceString).toNumber();
```
