# Fees

Pendle protocol has 2 revenue sources:

- **YT Fees**
    
Pendle collects a 5% fee from all yield accrued (including points) by all YT in existence, and all yields (including all points negotiated) from the SYs of matured unredeemed PTs.

- **YT Fees on Points**

Fees on points are applied similarly as Pendle treats points as a form of yield. Since points are tracked off-chain, partner protocols deduct the 5% fee when allocating points to user wallets. The deducted points from fees are then re-allocated to the following Pendle-controlled wallets:

Once the token rewards are claimable, the fee wallets will claim the rewards which will later be forwarded to vePENDLE holders.

- **Swap Fees**
    
Pendle collects a percentage-based swap fee, scaled with maturity, from all PT swaps. Each fee tier will be displayed in the dApp and is decided by the pool deployer (currently only the Pendle team deploys pools on Pendle). 

Pendle taxes the yield-receivables of PT when swaps occur. This creates a fair fee for all pools and maturities as it is scaled to a poolâ€™s maturity (less time to maturity -> less yield-receivables -> lower fees in $ terms). Since YT swaps are also routed through the PT AMM, its fees are calculated based on the PT swapped.

- **Fee Distribution**

Pendle has 2 sources of fees **YT fees** and **Swap fees**. 20% of all swap fees are given to LP providers of the pool as yield. 

The remaining swap fees and all YT fees are split between vePendle holders and Pendle protocol in the following ratio 
- 80% to vePendle
- 10% to Protocol Treasury
- 10% to Protocol Operations
