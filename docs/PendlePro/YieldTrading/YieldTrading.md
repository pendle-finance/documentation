# Yield Trading

## Introduction

By separating the yield from the asset, Pendle enables users to trade yield, unlocking a wide variety of strategies that asset holders can choose from. This is the core functionality of Pendle.

Besides securing high yields, you can also get massive discounts on assets, as well as earn additional yield on top of already insane APYs.

With V2 architecture, your yield trading potential is further improved, with reduced slippage and impermanent loss thanks to the new AMM.
