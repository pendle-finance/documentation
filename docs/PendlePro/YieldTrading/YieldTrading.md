# Yield Trading

By separating the yield from the asset, Pendle enables users to trade yield, unlocking a wide variety of strategies that asset holders can choose from. This is the core functionality of Pendle.

Besides securing high yields, you can also get massive discounts on assets, as well as earn additional yield on top of already insane APYs.

With V2 architecture, your yield trading potential is further improved, with reduced slippage and impermanent loss thanks to the new AMM.

## Market

**The numbers, Mason, what do they mean?**

The Market page displays all the important figures you need to make informed yield trading decisions. 

**Maturity** is the date at which PT becomes fully redeemable for the underlying asset and YT stops accruing yield. One asset can have multiple maturity dates, and there is an independent market for each maturity date, and as such the implied yield of an asset can differ across different maturities. 

**Underlying APY** is the prevailing yield rate of the underlying asset. This APY is determined by the protocol that created the asset. Underlying Value is the current market value of the asset in USD.
