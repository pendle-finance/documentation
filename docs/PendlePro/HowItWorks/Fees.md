# Fees

## Swap Fees 

Swap fees are dependent on the time to maturity. 

At 1 year to maturity, the swap fee is **0.10%** of the trade. This rate is higher if the time to maturity is longer, and lower if the time to maturity is shorter. 

**20%** of the fees goes to liquidity providers, while the rest is collected as protocol revenue and distributed pro rata to vePENDLE holders who voted for the pool, based on vote weight.

## Yield Fees

Pendle collects a fee of **3%** from all yield accrued via YT. This fee is collected as revenue and distributed pro rata to all vePENDLE holders, based on vePENDLE weight.
