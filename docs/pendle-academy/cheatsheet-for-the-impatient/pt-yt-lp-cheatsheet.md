# PT / YT / LP Cheatsheet

## What is Pendle

Pendle lets you earn better yields. We help you secure better certainty and better returns (i.e. higher APY üî•).

1. Earn fixed yield (with PT)
2. Provide liquidity (LP) to earn extra yield with minimal or zero impermanent loss (IL)
3. Long yield (with YT)

### PT & YT ‚Äî a quick round-up

Imagine Pendle being a marketplace where property owners can split and trade their principal (rights to the ownership of the property) and yield (rights to rental payments) separately. You can then sell or trade the yield portion even before maturity. This creates new ways to manage and even speculate on yield.

<Hint style="info">
üí° Using stETH as an example: **Principal** (Right to Principal of stETH) + **Yield** (Rights to stETH yield) = **Yield-bearing asset** (stETH)
</Hint>

#### **Principal Token (PT)**

* 1 PT lets you redeem 1 unit of the original asset at maturity date.
* PT is similar to [zero-coupon bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp) in traditional finance.

#### Yield **Token (YT)**

* 1 YT lets you receive the yield of 1 unit of the original asset until the maturity date, claimable in real-time.
* YT is similar to [detached coupons of bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp) in traditional finance.

<Hint style="danger">
**You can sell PT and YT anytime** on Pendle market, with _**no**_**&#x20;lock or penalty**, at market price. They are traded 24/7.
</Hint>

Perhaps the most important takeaway about PT & YT:

<Hint style="success">
üí° PT Price + YT Price = Underlying Asset Price

<summary>Can I profit if I early exit my PT?</summary>

When you exit early, your earnings will depend on the PT‚Äôs market price at exit. You may earn higher or lower (in extreme cases, at a loss) than the advertised APY at entry. Note that, however, PT is always 1:1 redeemable to the underlying asset at the maturity date, you do not necessarily need to sell under unfavorable short-term price moves.
