ðŸ’¡ Please note that there are many options available for \$PENDLE beyond what's mentioned in this document, e.g. LP on liquidity pools, lend \$PENDLE on lending markets, and more, to name a few. These strategies are developed by 3rd parties that are _not_ part of the Pendle team, _nor_ officially endorsed by Pendle. As always, **do your own research** and **understand the risks** when putting your assets to work in DeFi. Read the full disclaimer at the bottom of the page.

### Vote-escrowed PENDLE (vePENDLE)

* Developed by Pendle, **vote-escrowed PENDLE (vePENDLE) represents your governance share, and gives you access to protocol revenue and reward boost on Pendle**. Lock \$PENDLE for up to 2 years, your vePENDLE value is proportional to the amount and duration locked. The value decays over time and when it reaches zero your PENDLE is fully unlocked.
  * to create/update lock, start here: [https://app.pendle.finance/vependle/lock](https://app.pendle.finance/vependle/lock)
* Single-token exposure, so there is no impermanent loss (IL) involved.
* vePENDLE holders are entitled to:
  * Base APY
    * 5% fee collected from yield produced by all YT
    * 100% yield from all matured unredeemed PT
  * Voterâ€™s APY
    * vePENDLE holders vote for and direct the flow of rewards to different pools, effectively incentivizing liquidity in the pool they vote for
    * earn 80% of the swap fees from the pools you voted
  * LP reward boost ðŸ”¥
    * \$PENDLE incentives and rewards for all of your LPs will be boosted by up to 250% based on your vePENDLE value
* Practically, this strategy is suitable for larger capitals who LPs into many Pendle LP pools because the LP reward boost is the most valuable benefit.
