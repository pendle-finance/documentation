# FAQ

## General

### What does the maturity date mean?

Each PT and YT has an maturity date. For PT, you can redeem the full underlying yield-bearing token after this date. For YT, the yield of the yield-bearing token is only accrued up until the maturity date, after which YT has no value.

### What is an epoch?

For Pendle, an epoch is exactly one week. Each epoch starts at Thursday, 00:00 UTC and ends at Wednesday, 23:59 UTC.

Snapshots of vePENDLE voting are taken every epoch.

### Why is the Underlying APY shown on Pendle differ from the APY shown in the underlying protocol?

The Underlying APY displayed on Pendle is a 7-day average of the underlying protocol (with some assets like GLP as exceptions) to smoothen out short-term fluctuations of the underlying protocol's APY.

## Liquidity Provision

### What do I receive in return for providing liquidity?

* Swap fees generated by the pool
* PENDLE incentives
* Protocol incentives emitted by the underlying asset (e.g. $COMP, $AAVE)

### Do I have to stake my LP to earn rewards?

No, you do not have to stake LP tokens. All LP token holders will receive their fair share of the rewards.

## Security
