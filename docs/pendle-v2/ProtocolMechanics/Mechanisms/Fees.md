# Fees

Pendle protocol has 2 revenue sources:

- **YT Fees**
    
Pendle collects a 5% fee from all yield accrued (including points) by all YT in existence, and all yields (including all points negotiated) from the SYs of matured unredeemed PTs.

- **YT Fees on Points**

Fees on points are applied similarly as Pendle treats points as a form of yield. Since points are tracked off-chain, partner protocols deduct the 5% fee when allocating points to user wallets. The deducted points from fees are then re-allocated to the following Pendle-controlled wallets:

- **Swap Fees**
    
Pendle collects a percentage-based swap fee, scaled with maturity, from all PT swaps. Each fee tier will be displayed in the dApp and is decided by the pool deployer (currently only the Pendle team deploys pools on Pendle). 

Pendle taxes the yield-receivables of PT when swaps occur. This creates a fair fee for all pools and maturities as it is scaled to a pool’s maturity (less time to maturity -> less yield-receivables -> lower fees in $ terms). Since YT swaps are also routed through the PT AMM, its fees are calculated based on the PT swapped.

- **Fee Distribution**

Pendle has 2 sources of fees **YT fees** and **Swap fees**. 20% of all swap fees are given to LP providers of the pool as yield. 

The remaining swap fees and all YT fees are split between PENDLE buyback fund and Pendle protocol in the following ratio
- 80% for PENDLE buyback
- 10% to Protocol Treasury
- 10% to Protocol Operations

- **Trading Fee Calculation**

Trading fees are dynamically adjusted based on time remaining until maturity:

`Trading Fee = (Fee Tier / 365) * Days to Maturity`

The **Fee Tier** is specific to each market and can be found by clicking the "specs" button on the market's trading interface. Redeeming PT for the underlying asset *after* maturity incurs no protocol fee, only standard network gas fees.

- **Post-Maturity Yield Redirection**

If a user does not redeem their PT or LP position after maturity, the underlying asset remains in the SY contract and **continues to accrue yield and points**. However, all yield and points generated by these unredeemed, matured positions are automatically redirected to the **Pendle treasury fee wallet**. This incentivizes users to promptly redeem their matured assets and roll them over into new pools.
