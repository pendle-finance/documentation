As of September 2024, all team and investor tokens have fully vested. Any increase to circulating supply will be contributed by incentives and ecosystem building. 

## Weekly Emission
Weekly emission as of Sept-2024 is 216,076 with a 1.1% decrease each week until April 2026. At that point, it will switch to a terminal inflation rate of 2% per annum for incentives. 

As the industry matures, governance may propose changes based on the evolution of ecosystem best practices.
