# Season 2 Coming Soon
<!-- # Leaderboard (Beta)

![Leaderboard](/img/AppGuide/leaderboard.png "Leaderboard")

The Leaderboard is a new feature designed to gamify your Pendle experience by introducing some friendly, competitive elements.

On the Leaderboard, you’ll be able to view the Top 50 Yield Traders by their rank, sorted based on their overall P&L performance in dollar terms or percentage gain, as well as their daily rank changes.

These rankings are updated daily at 0000 UTC.

Rankings are finalized by the end of every Season (which will only be introduced when Beta ends), and higher ranks may lead to certain benefits in the future.

![Leaderboard to Dashboard](/img/AppGuide/leaderboard_to_dashboard.png "Leaderboard to Dashboard")

Click on each user on the Leaderboard to view their positions, which will bring up a page identical to your own Dashboard.

Do note however that the figures shown on the others’ dashboards will only be updated daily at 0000 UTC, similar to the Leaderboard. -->
