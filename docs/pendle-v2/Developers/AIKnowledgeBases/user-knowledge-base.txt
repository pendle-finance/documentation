Question: What happens to Boyco vault pools farming Berachain points on Pendle once Boyco goes live?||Once Boyco pool goes live, when will 1 to 1 redemption for underlying assets be enabled?||What happens once Boyco goes live?
Answer: Once boyco goes live, the tokens are locked up and you can no longer redeem to other assets besides underlying (i.e. liquidBeraETH, liquidBeraBTC, ctsUSDe etc.) However, at any point in time, you can still exit your PT/YT/LP positions to the underlying token. Redemption to native assets will be live a few months after berachain goes live. For specific assets, the supposed withdrawal schedules are as follow - LBTC + WBTC (Bera Concrete): 14 April 2025 - sUSDe + USDe (Bera Concrete): 1 to 3 months after Berachain live - SolvBTC.BERA: 90 days from Berachain live - BeraSTONE: End of Boyco campaign, but can exit via uniswap DEX currently - liquidBeraETH + liquidBeraBTC: 90 days from Berachain live

Question: what is the different between providing liquidity on Pendle vs on Uniswap?
Answer: Similar to many other DeFi protocols, you can also deposit your asset to provide liquidity to Pendle pools. Unlike traditional LP in decentralised exchange (DEX) like Uniswap, Pendle's LP consist of the underlying asset and its principle token PT, thus, Pendle's LP will have no impermanent loss at maturity because the two assets in the pool will converge to the same asset.

Question: 你好，我如果持有1个USUALx PT，pt时间到期后是不是ptusualx兑换成usualx的比例是1:1
Answer: 1 PT USUALx 到期是赎回「 1 $USUAL 价值的 $USUALx代币」。 购买PT是付出「未知的未来变动回报（质押USUAL所得的USUALx质押收益）」换取一个固定的利率收益。基本上就是传统金融中的利率互换。 PT的固定利率让你在到期时实现「将 1 PT-USUALx赎回相当于1个$USUAL价值的USUALx代币」。（到期前你以低于1个$USUAL的价格购买 1 PT-USUALx，之间的价差即是PT的固定收益）

Question: long yield apy为负的话代表什么呢？
Answer: 如果long yield APY为负，代表你付出的成本比你预期得到的利息收益为多。 但请注意，在**积分项目**的情况下，YT将收获积分，但由于这些积分价值未知，所以Pendle介面会假设积分价值为0。 此时若 YT的成本高于根据当前底层APY推算的应得收益（不含积分的预期收益），Long Yield APY将会显示为负值。

Question: I bought some YT Resolv, how can I claim Resolv points?
Answer: There is no need to claim Resolv points, they are automatically awarded to YT or LP holders by the protocol. In order to know how many points you are awarded, check the dashboard of the underlying protocol, in this case, Resolv's dashboard. Note that in some cases, points might not show in real-time and could take some time to appear due to the internal process of each protocol. In those cases, points are retroactively awarded and recorded on-chain, so you will receive them once the dashboard updates
