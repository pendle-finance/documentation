# FAQ

## General

### Glossary

**Yield-Bearing Token**

Yield-bearing Token is an umbrella term that refers to any token that generates yield. Examples include aUSDC, SLP tokens, and gOHM.

**SY = Standardized Yield**

SY is a token standard written by the Pendle team that wraps any yield-bearing token and provides a standardized interface for interacting with any yield-bearing tokenâ€™s yield generating mechanism. SY is a purely technical component, the user does not interact directly with SY.

**PT = Principal Token**

PT entitles you to the principal of the underlying yield-bearing token, redeemable after maturity. If you own 100 PT-aUSDC with 1 year maturity, you will be able to redeem 100 aUSDC after 1 year.

**YT = Yield Token**

YT entitles you to accrue the yield of the underlying yield-bearing token in real-time, and the yield accrued can be manually claimed _at any time_. If you own 100 YT-aUSDC and aUSDC has an average yield of 5% through the year, you will have accrued 5 aUSDC by the end of the year.

### What does the maturity date mean?

Each PT and YT has an maturity date. For PT, you can redeem the full underlying yield-bearing token after this date. For YT, the yield of the yield-bearing token is only accrued up until the maturity date, after which YT has no value.

### What is the difference between Simple UI and Pro UI?

Simple UI and Pro UI run on the same set of contracts and use the same tokens.

Simple UI is streamlined to perform the 2 main functions that are predicted to have the highest traffic in order to create a better UX for the majority of users.

Pro UI gives users the full suite of functions on Pendle, allowing users to yield trade by buying and selling PT and YT.

You can switch between the two modes by toggling the UI at the top right corner of the app.

### What is an epoch?

For Pendle, an epoch is exactly one week. Each epoch starts and ends at Thursday, 00:00 UTC.

Snapshots of vePENDLE voting are taken every epoch, and non-yield rewards (e.g. $COMP, $QI tokens) are also distributed every epoch.

## Liquidity Provision

### What do I receive in return for providing liquidity?

* Swap fees generated by the pool
* PENDLE incentives
* Protocol incentives emitted by the underlying asset (e.g. $COMP, $AAVE)

### Do I have to stake my LP to earn rewards?

No, you do not have to stake LP tokens. All LP token holders will receive their fair share of the rewards.

## Governance

### How does Pendle governance work?

### Blacklist if you kkb

### Is governance different on Ethereum vs Avalanche?

## Security

### Is Pendle audited?

The Pendle codebase has been fully audited by reputable auditors and all flaws have been addressed. Read the audit reports &lt;here>. Nonetheless, users are advised to exercise caution and deploy funds prudently.

### What risks are there associated with using the protocol?

Since Pendle interacts with third-party protocols and contracts, there is inherent risk associated with the smart contracts and systems deployed by the third-party protocols. Pendle is not responsible for any funds lost due to exploits in third-party contracts.
