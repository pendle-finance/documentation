# Apply Boost

If you lock vePENDLE before LPing, your LP will be automatically boosted. If you lock vePENDLE after LPing, you will have to manually apply the boost by following the steps below.

1. Access the boost page via the banner link in the [Dashboard](https://app.pendle.finance/pro/dashboard), which should appear when you have locked vePENDLE after LPing

2. To boost rewards for non-Ethereum pools, sync your vePENDLE from Ethereum*
