# vePENDLE

Pendleâ€™s governance is powered by Vote-escrowed PENDLE, or vePENDLE.

vePENDLE enables Pendle to be further decentralized. With vePENDLE, an array of new features are unlocked for $PENDLE holders, increasing the utility of the token.

As a result, it also creates another sink for the $PENDLE token, giving more stability to the price of the token and to the protocol.

## Getting vePENDLE

Stake $PENDLE and receive vePENDLE. Your vePENDLE value is proportional to the amount and duration staked (up to a maximum of 2 years). &lt;link tutorial>

Your vePENDLE value will decay over time, and reaches zero once the stake duration is over. Your staked $PENDLE will then be released.

To increase your vePENDLE value, you can choose to extend your staking duration and/or increase your staked amount.

## Earn Protocol Fees

A small percentage of all yield accrued is distributed to vePENDLE holders.

Pendle collects a fee of &lt;XX>% from all yield accrued via YT. &lt;YY>% of these fees will go to Pendle as protocol revenue, while the remaining &lt;ZZ>% will be distributed pro rata amongst all vePENDLE holders.

A portion of yield from expired PTs will be distributed pro rata to vePENDLE holders as well.

For example, expired PT-aUSDC is equivalent to aUSDC. If left unredeemed, all of its yield will be converted to a stablecoin and collected by the protocol, and a portion of the yield will be distributed to vePENDLE holders.

These rewards will be converted to USDC and distributed every epoch at Thursday, 00:00 UTC via Ethereum, regardless of where your vePENDLE is being held.

## Incentive Channelling

vePENDLE powers the incentive channelling mechanism on Pendle. vePENDLE holders vote for and direct the flow of rewards to different pools, effectively incentivizing liquidity in the pool they vote for.

Intuitively, the higher your vePENDLE value, the more incentives you are entitled to channel.

A snapshot of all votes is taken at the start of every epoch at Thursday, 00:00 UTC and the incentive rates for each pool will be adjusted accordingly.

Voting for a pool also entitles vePENDLE holders to &lt;XX>% of the swap fees collected by the pool.

## LP Reward Boost

If you LP in a pool while you are holding vePENDLE, your $PENDLE incentives and rewards for all of your LPs will be further boosted as well, by up to 250% based on your vePENDLE value.

Although your vePENDLE value decays over time, your LP boost rate is calculated at the time the boost is first applied. The boost rate will remain constant until you update your LP positions, in which case the rate will change based on your current vePENDLE value.

To receive boosted rewards, you should lock your $PENDLE into vePENDLE first before LPing.

If you are already LPing and want to boost your rewards with vePENDLE, you have to manually [apply the boost](// TODO link here) after voting for the pool.
