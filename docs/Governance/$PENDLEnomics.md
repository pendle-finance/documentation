## Emission

Pendle adopts a hybrid inflation model.

The emission will begin with stable incentives of 1.2M PENDLE per week for the first 26 weeks, following which, liquidity incentives will decrease by 1% a week until week 260. At this point, there will be a terminal inflation rate of 2% per annum based on the circulating token supply.

_Weekly Emission Rate_

The maximum number of tokens in circulation by the end of year 2 is 251,061,124. Any subsequent increments will come from liquidity incentives. The following chart shows the breakdown of our token allocation at the end of year 2:

_Weekly Emission Rate_

We have allocated the highest percentage to liquidity incentives as the team places a high priority on creating deep and liquid yield markets. The Pendle team will decide on the incentive distribution at the beginning and this will evolve into community governance as the protocol matures.

The token distribution was also planned such that everyone can have a reasonable chance of participating and owning a percentage of the $PENDLE ecosystem.

Perpetual inflation will also help ensure that constant contribution to the protocol is required to maintain an ownership position.
